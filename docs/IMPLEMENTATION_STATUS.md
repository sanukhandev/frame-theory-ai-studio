# Implementation Status — Resume Checkpoint

**Current status: PHOTO IMPORT CANVAS COMPLETE (2026-10-17).** FT-001 through FT-005, FT-101 through FT-105, FT-201 through FT-205, FT-301 through FT-304 and FT-401 are implemented and verified on Windows x64 with .NET SDK 10.0.100. FT-006 has a provisional Windows FFmpeg result and safe process adapter, but its two-OS/MLT acceptance gate is not complete. This is not a release.

- [x] FT-005 deterministic PPM/WAV/frame-counter fixture CLI and golden-byte comparison tests
- [~] FT-006 Windows FFmpeg encode/seek/multitrack smoke and `ArgumentList` process adapter; MLT and second-OS proof remain open
- [x] FT-101 normalized rational frame rates, frame ranges, stable media IDs and validated source metadata
- [x] FT-102 versioned project JSON, relative media references, legacy migration and atomic save/load
- [x] FT-103 immutable commands, inverse operations, named transactions and bounded undo/redo
- [x] FT-104 autosave/recovery, missing-media inspection/relink and persistent bounded cache index
- [x] FT-105 corruption/fuzz handling, oversize guards, typed upgrade errors and symlink containment checks
- [x] FT-201 safe local URI probe via ffprobe with duration, FPS, dimensions, audio, orientation and color metadata
- [x] FT-202 cancellable exact-frame FFmpeg decoder with bounded in-memory cache
- [x] FT-203 synchronized video/audio timeline graph with deterministic seek, scrub, step and sample mapping
- [x] FT-204 real local media import, thumbnail/waveform extraction and Avalonia drag/drop browser
- [x] FT-205 cancellable FFmpeg H.264/AAC export with progress, atomic finalization and ffprobe verification
- [x] FT-301 canonical color graph with explicit sRGB, Rec.709 and linear working profiles
- [x] FT-302 bounded exposure, contrast, saturation and temperature/tint grading operators
- [x] FT-303 bounded `.cube` 3D LUT parser, writer and trilinear interpolator
- [x] FT-304 atomic named preset store, shared pixel application and reversible project preset command
- [x] FT-401 FFmpeg-backed PNG/JPEG photo import, PPM preview and bounded canvas fit/100%/zoom/pan state

## Next tasks
1. FT-402 non-destructive crop, rotate, resize and transform operations.
2. Return to FT-006 when macOS/Linux native prerequisites and an MLT test host are available.
3. Iterate per docs/EPICS_AND_TASKS.md; update this checkpoint **after every tested commit**.

## Latest execution record
```text
Date/time: 2026-10-17
Task / Epic: FT-401 / E04
Git SHA: 88ed4cb (implementation 7403944)
Files changed: src/FrameTheory.Media/MediaProbe.cs, src/FrameTheory.Photo/PhotoCanvas.cs, src/FrameTheory.Photo/FrameTheory.Photo.csproj, tests/FrameTheory.UnitTests/MediaProbeTests.cs, tests/FrameTheory.UnitTests/PhotoCanvasTests.cs, tests/FrameTheory.UnitTests/PhotoImporterTests.cs, tests/FrameTheory.UnitTests/MediaExportTests.cs, tools/FrameTheory.PhotoImportSmoke/, FrameTheory.sln, docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
Actual behavior and UI path: `PhotoImporter` probes local PNG/JPEG media and decodes a real PPM preview. `PhotoCanvasState` supports fit, 100%, clamped zoom and pan state without modifying source bytes. Still-image extensions are classified as images even though ffprobe exposes a video stream.
Commands executed + OS: .NET 10.0.100 on Windows 11 x64; dotnet restore FrameTheory.sln; dotnet build FrameTheory.sln --no-restore --configuration Release --warnaserror; dotnet format FrameTheory.sln --no-restore --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal; dotnet test FrameTheory.sln --no-build --configuration Release; real `FrameTheory.PhotoImportSmoke` against temporary FFmpeg-generated PNG; git diff --check
Test outputs / exit codes: restore 0; build 0 with 0 warnings/0 errors; format verification 0; 39 unit tests and 1 golden test passed; real import reported Image, 16x8, 396 preview bytes and fit zoom 40.
Media fixtures and verification: Temporary FFmpeg-generated MP4 under `%TEMP%\frame-theory-ffmpeg-spike`; no media binary committed.
Known limitations / blockers: FT-006 remains partial pending MLT and second-OS evidence. Photo preview is PPM bytes and canvas state; crop/transform, persistent photo document wiring and visible canvas rendering remain later tasks. Python is not installed, so scripts/validate_repository.py was not run locally. macOS/Linux photo runs are unverified.
Next unblocked task: FT-402

## Release verification status

Linux: not built or tested locally. Gemini: not connected. Logo: source provided outside GitHub repository, not yet committed. MLT: not tested. Release native media: not approved or bundled.

## Honest reporting
Codex should not mark a task complete for a mock UI, TODO, downloaded asset, simulated exporter, docs-only passing CI, or speculative integration. If execution is interrupted, preserve status and resume from first unblocked task on next run.
