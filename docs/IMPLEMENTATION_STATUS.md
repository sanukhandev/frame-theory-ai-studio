# Implementation Status — Resume Checkpoint

**Current status: GEMINI CONFIGURATION COMPLETE (2026-10-17).** FT-001 through FT-005, FT-101 through FT-105, FT-201 through FT-205, FT-301 through FT-306, FT-401 through FT-405, FT-501 through FT-506, FT-601, FT-603 through FT-605 and FT-701 are implemented and verified on Windows x64 with .NET SDK 10.0.100. FT-602 has a strict source-bound provider contract and JSON fixture adapter, but real local ASR/Gemini transcription is not connected. FT-006 has a provisional Windows FFmpeg result and safe process adapter, but its two-OS/MLT acceptance gate is not complete. This is not a release.

## Next tasks
1. FT-702 explicit opt-in media scope selector and sampled local analysis job with cost/privacy disclosure.
2. Return to FT-006 when macOS/Linux native prerequisites and an MLT test host are available.
3. Iterate per docs/EPICS_AND_TASKS.md; update this checkpoint **after every tested commit**.

## Latest execution record
```text
Date/time: 2026-10-17
Task / Epic: FT-701 / E07
Git SHA: 0cdbe66
Files changed: src/FrameTheory.Application/Secrets.cs, src/FrameTheory.AI/GeminiConfiguration.cs, src/FrameTheory.Platform/OperatingSystemSecretStore.cs, src/FrameTheory.Desktop/GeminiSettingsViewModel.cs, src/FrameTheory.Desktop/MainWindow.cs, src/FrameTheory.Desktop/MainWindowViewModel.cs, tests/FrameTheory.UnitTests/GeminiConfigurationTests.cs
Actual behavior and UI path: The AI workspace exposes a built-in supported-model selector, masked user-key input, secure store/remove actions and status messages. Windows uses Credential Manager; macOS uses Keychain CLI and Linux uses Secret Service CLI when available. Missing keys or unavailable secure storage never disable manual offline editing.
Commands executed + OS: .NET 10.0.100 on Windows 11 x64; dotnet format FrameTheory.sln --no-restore --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal; dotnet build FrameTheory.sln --no-restore --configuration Release --warnaserror; dotnet test FrameTheory.sln --no-build --configuration Release --logger console\;verbosity=minimal; git diff --check; managed desktop launch smoke; real Windows Credential Manager round-trip test.
Test outputs / exit codes: format 0; build 0 with 0 warnings/0 errors; 79 unit tests and 2 golden tests passed; desktop stayed alive for 3 seconds; Credential Manager store/read/delete passed without logging the secret.
Media fixtures and verification: No media upload or network request occurs; manual editing remains local and unaffected by Gemini configuration.
Known limitations / blockers: The model catalog is built-in and Gemini planning/upload/provider execution are not connected; FT-702 must add explicit media-scope consent before any network path. FT-602 remains a contract/fixture adapter pending a real local ASR or consented Gemini provider. FT-006 remains partial pending MLT and second-OS evidence. Python is not installed, so scripts/validate_repository.py was not run locally. macOS/Linux secret-store and desktop runs are unverified.
Next unblocked task: FT-702

Linux: not built or tested locally. Gemini provider: not connected. Logo: source provided outside GitHub repository, not yet committed. MLT: not tested. Release native media: not approved or bundled.

## Honest reporting
Codex should not mark a task complete for a mock UI, TODO, downloaded asset, simulated exporter, docs-only passing CI, or speculative integration. If execution is interrupted, preserve status and resume from first unblocked task on next run.
